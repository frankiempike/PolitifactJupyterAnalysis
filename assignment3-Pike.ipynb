    "## Visualization Technique\n",
    "An **interactive heatmap** is a graphical representation of data where individual or aggregate values are represented by colors. In this technique, each cell in the grid corresponds to a data point or aggregate, and its color intensity reflects the magnitude of the value. The interactive component allows users to filter by an additional data value to dynamically adjust the data being displayed, making it easier to explore and analyze patterns within the dataset. I implemented this technique by preparing the data and putting it into a Pandas DataFrame, using the Plotly Graph Objects library's go.Heatmap function to create a static heatmap, then integrating it with ipywidgets to make the chart interactive using the interactive function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interactive heatmaps are great to use when dealing with datasets that have multiple categorical variables or dimensions (e.g., different sources, verdicts, years). They can help users drill down into specific subsets of data and easily see trends on multiple levels. There are limitations, though, so they are not a good idea if you have too many unique values in a categorical variable or if the data ranges are highly variable or skewed because it would be difficult to quickly perceive overall trends. Additionally, purely qualitative data is not a good fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "I also considered using a bar chart, which is straightforward and good for categorical data, or a bubble chart, which would add an extra dimension of information (size) to a scatter plot, but I went with an interactive heatmap because it allows clear visualization of patterns in aggregated data, which is useful for summarizing a large dataset such as this one. Additionally, a bar chart did not allow me to express all the variables I wanted to, and a bubble chart became cluttered and hard to interpret with so many data points."

    "Plotly is primarily a declarative library. You define what you want to plot, and Plotly handles the rendering and interactions. ipywidgets, on the other hand, is a procedural library. It allows users to create interactive widgets (e.g., sliders, dropdowns) and link them to Python code. This procedural approach lets you define the interaction logic and update visualizations dynamically. Both libraries are easy to use in Jupyter. In fact, ipywidgets was specifically made for Jupyter. \n",
    "\n",
    "When choosing which visualization libraries to use, I also considered Seaborn for its ease of creating heatmaps and Bokeh for its advanced interactivity. But ultimately, I chose Plotly with ipywidgets for its seamless integration of interactive features directly within Jupyter notebooks, offering a more user-friendly and dynamic experience for exploring data. It is complicated to make Seaborn's static visualizations interactive, even integrated with other libraries, and I found Bokeh to be overly complex and difficult to implement in Jupyter."
